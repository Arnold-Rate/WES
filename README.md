Herein is the Quality check for the project analyzing Whole Exome Sequencing Data. This is the preliminary quality check done using FastQC
I used Trimmomatic version 0.39 to run a trim removing adapters and identifying the reads using Illumina Clips from the sequencing used.
Identification of reference genome, sequence alignment, and SNV identification were followed afterwards.
Ultimately, I created an automated way of doing the quality checks on the sequence reads.
